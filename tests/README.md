## 🧪 Test Files

### Security Tests

#### `test-security.html`
**Purpose:** Automated security vulnerability testing  
**URL:** `http://localhost:5173/tests/test-security.html`

**Tests Include:**
- ✅ Storage Security (file upload validation)
- ✅ RLS Policy Tests (database access control)
- ✅ XSS Protection Instructions (manual testing)

**Usage:**
1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to test URL
3. Click "Run Complete Security Audit"
4. Review results and fix any vulnerabilities

**Expected Results:**
- All storage tests should show ✅ BLOCKED
- All RLS tests should show ✅ BLOCKED or ✅ SECURE
- XSS tests require manual verification

## 🔧 Test Categories

### 1. Security Testing
- **File Upload Security:** Validates file type, size, and path restrictions
- **Database Security:** Tests Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- **XSS Protection:** Manual testing for cross-site scripting vulnerabilities

### 2. Functional Testing
- **Admin Portal:** Login, navigation, CRUD operations
- **Public Site:** Event display, content loading, responsiveness
- **API Endpoints:** Authentication, data retrieval, error handling

### 3. Performance Testing
- **Page Load Times:** Initial load and navigation
- **Database Queries:** Response times and optimization
- **File Uploads:** Upload speed and size limits

## 🚨 Security Considerations

### Test Data Security
- Use non-production data for testing
- Don't use real user credentials
- Clean up sensitive test data
- Use separate test environment when possible

### Test Environment Isolation
- Isolate test environment from production
- Use test database for testing
- Don't run tests against production data
- Monitor test environment for security issues
