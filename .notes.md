- fix dark mode



- Shop page missing, maybe shopify

- Faq page

- slow video down on homepage


- EVENTS, create saved template of events that can be easly dragged onto the calendar. 

- Dogbar sora2 videos
- Upload videos to youtube and embed them on the site


- user managment, under the admin users include a new option to assign what permisions each role has. this is default super admin has all roles and cant be changed. we are just changing the other roles to restrict which pages and editing options each has, 

- check the roles actually work, and are passed in the JWT

- create an option to archive images and videos. this just hides the images from the media library but keeps them in the database. admin can unarchive if needed. so there should be a second view that shows the archived images and videos.
