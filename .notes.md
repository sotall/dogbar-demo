- Shop page missing, maybe shopify

- Faq page

- slow video down on homepage


- EVENTS, create saved template of events that can be easly dragged onto the calendar. 

- we need a logs page that captures every action in the database (does this make sense or bad practicve as the database would get bloated, where can we save logs)

- user managment, under the admin users include a new option to assign what permisions each role has. this is default super admin has all roles and cant be changed. we are just changing the other roles to restrict which pages and editing options each has, 

- create an option to archive images and videos. this just hides the images from the media library but keeps them in the database. admin can unarchive if needed. so there should be a second view that shows the archived images and videos.
